# 📘 Learning Portal – Reading Synopsis + Gen AI Grading

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application where participants of a corporate learning program can submit a reading synopsis. The system simulates sending the synopsis to a GenAI service, which returns a score and feedback. Admins can view and filter submissions based on title or score.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js & Redux toolkit 
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB 
- **Mock GenAI API**: Simulates evaluation of submitted synopsis

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Backend

1. Navigate to the Server folder.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

3.Create a .env file and add your environment variables:
# .env file
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/catalyst
PORT=3000

Start the backend server:
npm run dev

Frontend
Navigate to the Client folder.
Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the frontend application:
npm start


🧠 GenAI Simulation
💡 Purpose
To emulate a real-world scenario where submitted content is evaluated by a GenAI system for structure, insightfulness, and originality. The simulation helps mimic how such a system might behave using a mock scoring engine.

⚙️ How It Works
Instead of connecting to a real AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), we use a mock function that:

Accepts the synopsis text.

Randomly generates a score between 0 and 10.

Associates the score with preset feedback messages like:

"Excellent summary! Well-structured and insightful."

"Good effort, but consider adding more detail or depth."

If the score > 8.0, the system assumes high likelihood of AI usage and sets:

score = 0

feedback: "The submission appears to be heavily assisted by AI. Please try to write in your own words"
